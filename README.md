# el84_injector_0.0

`el84_injector_0.0` is a code injection tool developed for educational and security research purposes. It demonstrates advanced techniques in code injection and evasion, focusing on Windows environments. The tool utilizes API hashing, custom encoding/decoding methods, and direct manipulation of process memory to inject payloads into target processes without detection by Windows Defender.

- **API Hashing**: Utilizes API hashing to locate necessary WinAPI functions dynamically.
- **XOR Encoding**: Encodes WinAPI function pointers with a random 64-bit value (XOR) to evade static analysis.
- **FCALL Macro**: Simplifies WinAPI calls, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Custom Encoding/Decoding**: Implements a basic custom method for payload encoding and decoding to bypass security measures.
- **Simple Usage**: Designed for easy use, requiring only the target process ID and a payload saved as `shellcode.bin` in the project directory.

## Usage
1. Place your x64 payload in a file named `shellcode.bin` in the project directory.
2. Run `build.sh` to compile the injector. This script automates the process, including payload encoding and injector compilation.
3. Execute `injector.exe` with the target process ID as the command line argument:

```bash
./injector.exe <pid>
```

## Building from Source
The project can be built on systems with GCC and Mingw-w64 installed. The build process involves compiling helper programs for hash generation and payload encoding, followed by the main injector program.

**Dependencies:**
- GCC (for hash and encode utilities)
- x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc (for compiling the injector on non-Windows platforms)
- Any necessary libraries for Windows API calls

**Build Steps:**
Refer to the `build.sh` script for detailed build commands and steps.
